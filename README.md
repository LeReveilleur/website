The script will automatically generate the article in the folder `content/post`
with the name `auto_generated__{$CREATION_DATE}_{$TITLE}`.

### How to add the bibliography sources for a video post?

1. create the following directory `scripts/data/video/source/{$youtube_id}`
   using the `youtube_id` of the video.
2. Create an `index.md` file that can contain markdown content for the
   bibliography section.
3. If assets are needed, create a folder
   `scripts/data/video/source/{$youtube_id}/bibliography/` and put
   them under this folder.
